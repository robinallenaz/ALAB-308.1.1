# ALAB 308.1.1: Data Manipulation with JavaScript

This project demonstrates various JavaScript data manipulation techniques through two main exercises:

## Part 1: Math Problems
Implemented a series of number validations and calculations:
- Verified four numbers add up to 50
- Checked for at least two odd numbers
- Ensured no number exceeds 25
- Validated number uniqueness
- Added checks for divisibility by 5
- Compared first and last numbers
- Performed arithmetic chain operations

## Part 2: Road Trip Calculator
Created a practical application to analyze a 1,500-mile road trip:
- Calculated fuel requirements at different speeds
- Analyzed fuel efficiency (MPG) at various speeds:
  - 55 mph: 30 MPG
  - 60 mph: 28 MPG
  - 75 mph: 23 MPG
- Determined if $175 fuel budget is sufficient
- Calculated trip duration at different speeds
- Provided analysis of the most efficient travel speed

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Node.js

## Files
- `dataManipulation.js`: Contains all the JavaScript code for both parts
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## How to Run
1. Ensure Node.js is installed on your system
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the script using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node dataManipulation.js
   ```
